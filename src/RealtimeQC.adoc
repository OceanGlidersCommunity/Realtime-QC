= Realtime Quality Control for Underwater Gliders

== Statement of Purpose

== Inbox - Content to be processed

Here I'll add texts from our discussions that should be processed and organized
in this new document. Mostly copy-n-paste so we don't loose anything.

Topics that reached a consensus

=== What defines real-time QC?
=== Why do real-time QC?

This document is focused on underwater gliders. Other platforms referred to as
gliders but with a different nature of operation, such as wave gliders could
probably take advantage of this document but specific issues of those platforms
will not be covered here, at least at this first iteration.

Mark: Agreed. Good to specify whatâ€™s included, and to constrain the scope so that the result is both achievable and sufficiently specific to be useful.


=== What defines real-time QC?
=== Why do real-time QC?
=== Should we modify the data?
=== Not only automatic procedures

== Main Document

//Underwater gliders only
This document is focused on underwater gliders, which use changes in buoyancy as the main propulsion, thus characterized by relatively slow propagation velocities.
Other types of platforms with different natures of operation, such as wave gliders and propelled underwater autonomous vehicles, might take advantage of this document but there is no intention on covering specific aspects of those other platforms.

== History

Virtual synchronous meeting on XXX.
(add participants/contributors on each step.

=== Virtual workshop

Between May 11 - 15 2021

(I think we had one single sync meeting. Find the correct date/time, participants, and notes taken)

=== Async discussions from Apr 10 2021 to July 19 2021
Title Best Practices on Realtime QC

=== Called: Main document

Contacted people by email.

Asynchronous discussions through a Google Docs initiated on Feb 2021 and contributions extended up to Oct 2021.

A Google Doc was choosen at that time to reduce the technical barrier and expand
the participation and contributions.
