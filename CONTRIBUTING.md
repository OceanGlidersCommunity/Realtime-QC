# Contributing to Realtime Quality Control documentation

Thank you for considering investing your time contributing to our project!
Any contribution counts and only with a wide and diverse participation we
can reflect the knowledge and opinions of our community. The goal of this
document is to guide you how to participate and what to expect while making
this process as friendly and efficient as possible.

Please, take a moment to read our *Code of Conduct*.

**ATTENTION** this document is in active development. This is just a starting
point. Expect changes from the newly formed committee.
The CF-Conventions is a well established and experienced community and might
be a good reference for our procedures.

## Rules for the documentation development

This is a community document that must conciliate with the diversity of
underwater glider operators. We shall not expect that there is one single
best way of doing it, and we must accommodate and reflect the differences of
opinions. We shall make clear when there is more than one common standard.

A committee of maintainers will regulate changes and additions. This committee
was initially formed by volunteers among the group that initiated this
discussions (see the history in the main document for more details).
This committee shall rotate, allowing regular change for new members in a
procedure and timing to be defined.
This committee must be diverse to reflect our community and composed by
experts in the field with actual knowledge and experience with underwater
gliders.
This committee shall act to represent the community and make decisions with
the community in mind over our own personal operations.

This document will follow the American english standard.

- Anyone can initiate discussions or propose changes;
- Changes, including additions, will be presented as *Pull Requests*.
- Proposes can start as a discussion in the form of an *issue*.
- Every new proposal should have a member of the maintainers committee
  as volunteer moderator as early as possible. The job of the moderator is to
  help the discussion and guide the proponent to move forward to a decision -
  approved or not.
- To be approved, the propose (the pull request) must obtain the approval
  of at least 3 members from the committee. One single vote against is
  enough to stall the process, thus requiring further discussions.
- The committee should keep in mind that this is not a personal vote, but
  those should use their technical knowledge to represent the opinions and
  desires of the community.
- Once obtained the necessary votes, the propose should wait for at least ten
  days before been merged to allow review and new opinions from the community.
- Approved changes should reflect in prompt update in the official document.
- All contributions must be properly acknowledged in the document. Rejected
  proposals might still result in acknowledgment of the proponent when
  resulted in useful discussions as judged by the moderator.
